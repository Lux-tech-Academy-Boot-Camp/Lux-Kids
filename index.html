Python was originally conceptualized by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s as a member of the National Research Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science.

Initially, it was designed as a response to the ABC programming language that was also foregrounded in the Netherlands.

Python is a free and open source high level programming language which is interplated, which supports object oreinted, procedural oriented, functional and imperative oriented programming paradigm.

            JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 during his time at Netscape Communications.

JavaScript was initially developed for client-side and has been improved to server side programming language, also with the use of react native you can build Hybrid Mobile application.

It is an object based language which employes the use of object and methods in programming.

Remember - In JavaScripts objects are king, when you are good at Objects you are good in JavaScript.

            TypeScript is a programming language designed for large-scale JavaScript application development, it has been designed as a typed superset of JavaScript.

This means we’ve actually been writing TypeScript this whole time! 🎉.This language allow us to use features from the most recent ECMAScript versions and even some features that are not even in the scope of the standard.

Here we are going to learn TypeScript in Depth and use it to build demo apps Using angular and TypeScript.
